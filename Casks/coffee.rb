    <<~EOS
      coffee needs to run `pmset -a disablesleep` as root. This cask tried to
      grant your user passwordless sudo for exactly that command during install
      (you may have been prompted for your password).

      If that step was skipped or declined, plain `coffee` will only work when
      you already have a cached sudo credential — otherwise run `sudo coffee`
      instead, or add the sudoers rule yourself (see README).
